# Fix My Code Challenge

This repository contains solutions to the "Fix My Code Challenge," a unique project where you will dive into existing code bases and fix issues. Whether you are familiar with the programming language or not, the goal is to identify and correct errors without rewriting the entire code.

## Project Overview

### FizzBuzz (Task 0)

The Python FizzBuzz implementation has a bug where it incorrectly prints "Fizz" instead of "FizzBuzz" for the number 15. Your task is to fix this issue.

- **File:** 0-fizzbuzz.py
- **Instructions:** Execute the script with `./0-fizzbuzz.py 50` and ensure that 15 prints "FizzBuzz."

### Print Square (Task 1)

The JavaScript code for printing a square is not producing the expected output for certain inputs. Fix the code to generate the correct square pattern.

- **File:** 1-print_square.js
- **Instructions:** Run the script with `./1-print_square.js 10` and ensure it prints a square of size 10.

### Sort (Task 2)

The Ruby script for sorting arguments is not functioning correctly. Your task is to fix the sorting issue in the script.

- **File:** 2-sort.rb
- **Instructions:** Run the script with `ruby 2-sort.rb 12 41 2 C 9 -9 31 fun -1 32` and verify that the output is correctly sorted.

### User Password (Task 3)

The Python implementation of the User class has an issue with the `is_valid_password` method. Ensure that the tests do not print any errors.

- **File:** 3-user.py
- **Instructions:** Execute the script with `./3-user.py` and confirm that the `is_valid_password` method behaves as expected.

### Double Linked List (Task 4)

The C implementation of a double linked list is not producing the expected output. Fix the issues in the code to ensure proper functionality.

- **Files:**
  - main.c
  - free_dlistint.c
  - print_dlistint.c
  - add_dnodeint_end.c
  - delete_dnodeint_at_index.c
- **Instructions:**
  1. Compile the code with `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 main.c free_dlistint.c print_dlistint.c add_dnodeint_end.c delete_dnodeint_at_index.c -o delete_dnodeint`.
  2. Run the executable with `./delete_dnodeint` and verify that the output is correct.
